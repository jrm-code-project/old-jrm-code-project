So what on earth is the license for the code in ChangeSafe?  The copyright notice on each file
looks awfully scary.

As one reader pointed out, it could take some work to properly release this under a BSD
license.  I'm a programmer, not a lawyer, so I don't know what would be involved.

However,
  The scary copyright notice notwithstanding, I declare that the ChangeSafe code checked in to
this repository to be available for use under the "New BSD License" as described
here:  http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause
  I expect and intend that the code be distributed and used in whole or in part by anyone who
wishes to do so.
  ChangeSafe, LLC assumes no responsibility for the use or reliability of this software.
  ChangeSafe, LLC reserves the right to create and license its own derivative software.
  
In plain English:
  Use the code!  Have fun!  ChangeSafe won't sue.  Not even if you take the entire thing as is
and try to sell it.
  You agree that:
      You may not use the code if you try to sue ChangeSafe.
      ChangeSafe is under no obligation to maintain or repair the code.
      ChangeSafe is under no obligation to inform anyone about problems discovered or adverse
  consequences of using the code, no matter how severe.
      If ChangeSafe LLC builds a product based on this software, we keep any new code and are
  under no obligation to release it.

P.S.  No doubt someone will find some technicality to worry about.  ChangeSafe LLC is happy
to consider other licensing terms.  But if you aren't worried enough to consult your own
lawyer, our consideration will be limited to peals of laughter.
